Django fabtastic
================

A small collection of class based fabric commands for deploying django on debian/ubuntu systems.
Status is mega mega alpha, the methods themselves are already in quasi production, but I am
refactoring everything to make it more generic.


Requirements & Installation
---------------------------

Requires fabric. Use PIP to install it from git.

    pip install -e git+http://...


Usage
-----

Fabtastic was made with a certain deployment workflow in mind following django deployment good practice,
including virtualenv+pip use.

Fabtastic includes a set of functions that are often needed with fabric deployments, ie.:

ve_run(command):                    run a command from within a virtualenv.
pip_install_requirements():         install python requirements from a pip requirements file.
install_packages(list):             installs system packages from list


Fabtastic also includes a set of class based fabric commands for setting up common packages including
databases, webservers, etc...

Each fabstastic class has the following 4 methods:
     install
     configure
     setup* (normally a shortcut for install & configure)
     reload

If for any reason you have to change how one these commands work, you can just override the method.


The default workflow for configuring system services is normally buy either symlinking, copying,
or running a configuration file. You have to define env.confdir in order for the service configuration
to work.


Sorry, to be continued!
